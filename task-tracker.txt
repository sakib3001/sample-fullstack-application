Step-01:- (Containerization)
  - Frontend containerize and test 
  - Understand the dependency for the Backend Like ( DB , Redis )
  - Make the DB and Redis up and set the endpoint for backend in the sample.env .
  - Write a simple Dockerfile for the Backend Service and then test.
  - If the Backend service is up and running without any error log then
    connect it with the Frontend service. 
  - If the Whole app is working fine then optimize the Dockerfiles and the docker-compose.yml

Issue and Fix During Step-01:-
  - The prisma schema migration : this has been fixed via -> npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma
  - Issue with the connectivity -> http://localhost:8777 <-> http://backend:8777

Step-02:- (Implementing CI)
  - Set CI for Backend
  - Set CI for Frontend
